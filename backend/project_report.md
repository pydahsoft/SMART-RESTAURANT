## Key Files Analysis

### Backend Files
1. **routes/orders.js**
   - Handles order management endpoints
   - Contains routes for:
     - Creating orders (POST /)
     - Getting user orders (GET /my-orders)
     - Getting specific order (GET /:orderId)
     - Getting all orders (GET /all-orders)
     - Updating order status (PATCH /:orderId/status)
   - Currently requires authentication for all routes

2. **server.js**
   - Main Express server configuration
   - Sets up middleware and routes

### Frontend Files
1. **OrderManagementPage.jsx**
   - Displays order management interface
   - Currently experiencing 401 Unauthorized errors
   - React Router deprecation warnings present

## Current Issues
1. Authentication Issues:
   - GET /api/orders/all-orders returning 401 Unauthorized
   - Routes are currently protected by authentication middleware

2. React Router Warnings:
   - Future flag warnings for v7 features
   - startTransition warning
   - Relative route resolution warning

## Dependencies
- Backend: Express.js, MongoDB
- Frontend: React, React Router

## Next Steps
1. Remove authentication requirement for public routes
2. Update React Router configuration
3. Implement proper error handling
